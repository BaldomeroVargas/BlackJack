Hello! Here are some rules to playing BlackJack on this system.
Make sure that each player is aware it is their turn, so
if it is Player 1 turn then only player 1 should look at the screen.
This is used for precausion to keep the hand secretive to the player.



Commands
D/d - draw
H/h - hold

Goodluck :)
